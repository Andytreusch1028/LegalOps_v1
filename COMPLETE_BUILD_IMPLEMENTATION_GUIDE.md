## AI Implementation Details

### OpenAI Integration
```typescript
// lib/ai/openai-service.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

export class OpenAIService {
  private openai: OpenAI;
  
  constructor() {
    this.openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    });
  }
  
  async processCustomerInquiry(inquiry: string, context: any) {
    const completion = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: `You are an AI assistant for LegalOps, a legal operations platform. 
          You provide ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE ONLY and do not provide legal advice.
          Always include disclaimers about not providing legal advice.
          If asked for legal advice, redirect to consulting with a qualified attorney.`
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: inquiry
        }
      ],
      max_tokens: 1000,
      temperature: 0.7
    });
    
    const response = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content || '';
    
    // UPL compliance check
    const isCompliant = await this.checkUPLCompliance(response);
    
    return {
      content: isCompliant ? response : this.getComplianceResponse(),
      compliant: isCompliant,
      tokens: completion.usage?.total_tokens || 0,
      cost: this.calculateCost(completion.usage?.total_tokens || 0)
    };
  }
  
  private async checkUPLCompliance(content: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const prohibitedPatterns = [
      /you should.*legal/i,
      /i recommend.*legal/i,
      /legal advice/i,
      /this means.*law/i
    ];
    
    return !prohibitedPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(content));
  }
  
  private getComplianceResponse(): string {
    return "I can only provide administrative assistance. For legal guidance on this matter, please consult with a qualified attorney. I can help you with administrative tasks and platform questions.";
  }
  
  private calculateCost(tokens: number): number {
    // GPT-4 pricing: $0.03 per 1K prompt tokens, $0.06 per 1K completion tokens
    return (tokens / 1000) * 0.045; // Average cost
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```typescript
// lib/ai/agent-coordinator.ts
export class AIAgentCoordinator {
  private agents: Map<string, AIAgent>;
  
  constructor() {
    this.agents = new Map([
      ['onboarding', new OnboardingAgent()],
      ['support', new SupportAgent()],
      ['document', new DocumentAgent()],
      ['workflow', new WorkflowAgent()]
    ]);
  }
  
  async routeRequest(request: AIRequest): Promise<AIResponse> {
    const agent = this.determineAgent(request);
    const response = await agent.process(request);
    
    // Check if handoff to another agent is needed
    if (response.requiresHandoff) {
      const nextAgent = this.agents.get(response.handoffTo);
      if (nextAgent) {
        return await nextAgent.process({
          ...request,
          context: { ...request.context, previousAgent: agent.name }
        });
      }
    }
    
    return response;
  }
  
  private determineAgent(request: AIRequest): AIAgent {
    // Intelligent routing based on request content
    const content = request.prompt.toLowerCase();
    
    if (content.includes('getting started') || content.includes('how to')) {
      return this.agents.get('onboarding')!;
    }
    
    if (content.includes('document') || content.includes('file')) {
      return this.agents.get('document')!;
    }
    
    if (content.includes('status') || content.includes('order')) {
      return this.agents.get('workflow')!;
    }
    
    return this.agents.get('support')!; // Default
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### AI Testing Framework
```typescript
// tests/ai/ai-testing.ts
describe('AI Services', () => {
  test('UPL Compliance', async () => {
    const testCases = [
      'What type of business should I form?', // Should redirect to attorney
      'How do I upload my documents?', // Should provide admin help
      'What is the status of my order?' // Should provide status info
    ];
    
    for (const testCase of testCases) {
      const response = await aiService.processRequest({
        prompt: testCase,
        agentType: 'support',
        userId: 'test-user'
      });
      
      expect(response.complianceChecked).toBe(true);
      if (testCase.includes('should I form')) {
        expect(response.requiresHumanReview).toBe(true);
      }
    }
  });
  
  test('Response Time Performance', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const response = await aiService.processRequest({
      prompt: 'How do I check my order status?',
      agentType: 'support',
      userId: 'test-user'
    });
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    
    expect(responseTime).toBeLessThan(2000); // <2 seconds
    expect(response.content).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Load Testing
```typescript
// tests/load/load-testing.ts
describe('Platform Load Testing', () => {
  test('Concurrent Users', async () => {
    const concurrentUsers = 100;
    const promises = Array.from({ length: concurrentUsers }, (_, i) => 
      simulateUserSession(`user-${i}`)
    );
    
    const results = await Promise.all(promises);
    const successRate = results.filter(r => r.success).length / results.length;
    
    expect(successRate).toBeGreaterThan(0.95); // 95% success rate
  });
});
```
