## Complete Build-First Strategy (6-Month Plan)

**STRATEGIC APPROACH:** Build complete AI-powered platform before customer launch

**Months 1-2:** Foundation & Core Platform - Self-development + $4K operations
**Months 3-4:** AI Implementation & Integration - $6K (includes AI services)
**Months 5-6:** Testing, Polish & Launch - $5K (launch marketing)
**Total Investment:** $15K + your development time (400-500 hours)

### Month 1: Foundation Skills + AI Architecture Planning (ENHANCED)
**Goal:** Build core skills while designing AI-ready architecture for future integration

#### Week 1: Environment & Git + AI Planning (3-4 days)
**Existing Tasks:**
- [ ] VS Code setup with extensions
- [ ] Git basics (you'll pick this up quickly)
- [ ] Node.js and npm/pnpm installation
- [ ] Create first Next.js project

**NEW AI-Ready Tasks:**
- [ ] **Research AI integration patterns** (2 hours)
- [ ] **Design AI-ready database schema** (include future AI tables)
- [ ] **Plan modular architecture** for easy AI integration

}
```
