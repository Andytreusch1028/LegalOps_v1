## 🎯 Integrated Development Strategy

### **Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
1. **Never Break What Works** - Test existing functionality before adding new features
2. **Test Early, Test Often** - Write tests before writing code (TDD approach)
3. **Small, Safe Steps** - Build one feature at a time, complete each phase before moving to the next
4. **UPL Compliance** - Document preparation only, no legal advice provided
5. **Spec-Driven Development** - Follow spec-kit methodology for all features

### **Technology Stack Integration**
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI v5+
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress (frontend), Jest + Supertest (backend)
- **Security**: JWT + Passport.js, OAuth 2.0, bcrypt password hashing
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes (EKS), AWS infrastructure
- **UPL Compliance**: Attorney review workflows, disclaimer systems, educational content only
