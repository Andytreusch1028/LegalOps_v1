## Technical Implementation Comparison

### Managed AI Implementation (Recommended Start)

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Simple, clean implementation
class ManagedAIService {
  private openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
  private claude = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });

  async processRequest(prompt: string, context: any): Promise<AIResponse> {
    try {
      // Primary service
      const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
        max_tokens: 1000
