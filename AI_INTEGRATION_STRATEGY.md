  const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);

  const sendMessage = async (message) => {
    setIsTyping(true);

    // UPL Compliance Filter
    const response = await fetch('/api/ai/admin-chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message,
        context: userContext,
        complianceMode: 'administrative-only'
      })
    });

    const aiResponse = await response.json();

    // Always include disclaimer
    const responseWithDisclaimer = {
      ...aiResponse,
      disclaimer: "This is administrative guidance only. Not legal advice. Consult qualified legal counsel for legal matters."
    };

    setMessages(prev => [...prev, responseWithDisclaimer]);
    setIsTyping(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <UPLDisclaimer />
      <ChatInterface onSend={sendMessage} isTyping={isTyping} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Backend AI Services (UPL Compliant)
```javascript
// Example: UPL-Compliant Document Processing Service
class AdminDocumentService {
  async processDocument(documentBuffer) {
    // Administrative processing only - NO legal analysis
    const analysis = await this.aiModel.processAdministratively(documentBuffer);

    return {
      documentType: analysis.documentType, // Administrative categorization
      metadata: analysis.extractedMetadata, // Data extraction only
      filingCategory: analysis.suggestedCategory, // Administrative filing
      processingSuggestions: analysis.workflowRecommendations, // Process optimization
      disclaimer: "Administrative processing only. No legal analysis provided.",
      uplCompliant: true
    };
  }

  // Compliance filter to prevent legal advice
  filterForUPLCompliance(response) {
    const prohibitedTerms = ['legal advice', 'recommend', 'should', 'legal risk'];
    // Filter out any responses that could constitute legal advice
    return response.filter(item => !this.containsLegalAdvice(item));
