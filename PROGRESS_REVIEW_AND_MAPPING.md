5. Create basic project structure
```

#### **Project Structure to Create**
```
legalops-platform/
├── app/                    # Next.js 14 app directory
│   ├── (auth)/            # Authentication routes

├── lib/                   # Utility functions
│   ├── auth.ts           # Authentication config
│   ├── db.ts             # Database connection
│   └── ai/               # AI services (for Month 3)
├── prisma/               # Database schema
└── public/               # Static assets
```

### **Step 2: Month 2 Core Platform (2 weeks)**

#### **Week 1-2: Payment & Order System**
```typescript
// Build these core features
interface CoreFeatures {
  authentication: "NextAuth.js with email/password",
  payments: "Stripe integration for LLC formation",
  orders: "Order management and tracking",
  dashboard: "User dashboard with order status"
}
```

#### **Week 3-4: Polish & Prepare for AI**
```typescript
interface PlatformPolish {
  responsiveUI: "Mobile-friendly design",
  validation: "Form validation and error handling", 
  security: "Basic security implementation",
  aiPreparation: "AI service interfaces and mock implementations"
}
```

### **Step 3: Month 3-4 AI Implementation (4 weeks)**

#### **AI Services Integration**
```typescript
// Your AI implementation roadmap
interface AIImplementation {
  month3Week1_2: {
    openaiIntegration: "GPT-4 API setup",
    claudeBackup: "Claude API integration",
    uplCompliance: "Legal advice filtering",
    customerChat: "24/7 AI support"
