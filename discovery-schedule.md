> Replace placeholder dates as you secure time slots. Mark "In progress" milestones with notes on which resource you're using.

## Skills Ramp Tracking
- Keep a simple progress log in `docs/learning/progress.md` (course name, status, key takeaways).
- Save sandbox projects under `sandboxes/` (gitignored if desired) for future reference.
- Capture lingering questions in `docs/learning/open-questions.md` to revisit during Phase 0.

## Stakeholder & Compliance Workflows
- **Interview/Research Plan:** Use `docs/phase0/interview-guide.md`, adapt per stakeholder, and note findings in `docs/phase0/notes/`.
- **Compliance Deep Dive:** Follow agenda in blueprint, record guardrails in `docs/phase0/compliance-guardrails.md`.

## Personal Coordination Checklist
- [ ] Calendar blocks created for each milestone.
- [ ] Study resources bookmarked/downloaded.
- [ ] Interview outreach emails drafted/sent.
- [ ] Notes captured after every session or study block.
- [ ] Risk register and backlog updated as insights appear.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Populate milestone table with tentative dates.
2. Create `docs/learning/progress.md` and start logging selected courses.
3. Reach out to stakeholders/advisors to schedule discovery conversations.
