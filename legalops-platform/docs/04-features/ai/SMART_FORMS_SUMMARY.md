## 📊 The Difference

LLC Formation (First Time):
├─ Enter personal info (name, email, phone, address)
├─ Enter business info (name, address)
├─ Enter registered agent info (name, address)
└─ Enter manager info (name, address)
    Total: ~20 fields

Annual Report (6 months later):
├─ Enter personal info AGAIN ❌
├─ Enter business info AGAIN ❌
├─ Enter registered agent info AGAIN ❌
└─ Enter manager info AGAIN ❌
    Total: ~20 fields AGAIN

Total Data Entry: 40 fields
Customer Experience: Frustrating 😤
```

### ✅ NEW WAY (With Smart Forms)

**Scenario**: Same customer, same filings

```
LLC Formation (First Time):
├─ Enter personal info (name, email, phone, address)
├─ Enter business info (name, address)
├─ Enter registered agent info (name, address)
└─ Enter manager info (name, address)
    Total: ~20 fields
    ✅ Saved to database

├─ Business info: ✅ Auto-filled
├─ Registered agent: ✅ Auto-filled
