## 🎯 Top 5 AI Features (UPL-Compliant)

### **1. AI Document Summarization** 🤖
**What it does:**
- Reads scanned registered agent mail (OCR)
- Generates plain English summary
- Extracts deadlines and adds to calendar
- Detects junk mail and scams

**Example:**
```
🏛️ Florida Department of State - Annual Report Reminder

🤖 AI Summary:
"This is a reminder notice for your 2025 annual report filing.
Florida LLCs are generally required to file by May 1st. The notice
includes instructions and payment information. No immediate action
required if you've already filed."

📅 Deadline Detected: May 1, 2025 [Add to Calendar]
```

**UPL Compliance:** ✅ Providing summaries is **legal information**, not advice.

---

### **2. Business Health Score** 📊
**What it does:**
- Calculates 0-100 score based on:
  - Compliance status (deadlines met)
  - Document completeness (all required docs uploaded)
  - Timeliness (response time to tasks)
- Shows trend over time
- Provides predictive insights

**Example:**
```
Business Health Score: 95/100 🟢 Excellent
████████████████████████░░░░

🤖 AI Insight:
"Your score will drop to 75 in 30 days if the annual report
isn't filed. File now to maintain your excellent rating."
```

**UPL Compliance:** ✅ Scoring compliance is **legal information**, not advice.

---

### **3. Smart Action Center** 🎯
**What it does:**
- Prioritizes tasks by urgency (red, yellow, green)
- Provides plain English explanations
- Shows estimated cost and time
- Offers one-click filing

**Example:**
```
🔴 URGENT (Due in 15 days)
📋 File 2025 Annual Report
Due: May 1, 2025 | State Fee: $138.75

🤖 AI Summary:
"Florida LLCs are generally required to file annual reports by
May 1st each year. The state filing fee is $138.75. Late filings
may incur penalties starting at $400. We can prepare and file
this for you."

[File Now - $50 + State Fee] [Remind Me in 7 Days]
```

**UPL Compliance:** ✅ Explaining requirements is **legal information**, not advice.

---

### **4. Junk Mail Detection** ⚠️
**What it does:**
- AI classifier trained on common RA scams
- Flags solicitations and fake government notices
- Warns customers not to respond
- Saves time and prevents fraud

**Example:**
```
⚠️ Unknown Sender - "URGENT: Business Compliance Required"

🤖 AI Warning: ⚠️ LIKELY JUNK MAIL / SCAM
"This appears to be a solicitation, not an official government
notice. Common indicators: urgent language, unfamiliar sender,
requests for payment. You are not required to respond."

[Mark as Junk] [Report Scam]
```

**UPL Compliance:** ✅ Identifying scams is **consumer protection**, not legal advice.

---

### **5. Predictive Insights** 🔮
**What it does:**
- Predicts future compliance issues
- Recommends actions to improve health score
- Benchmarks against similar businesses
- Calculates cost savings vs DIY

**Example:**
```
🤖 AI INSIGHTS FOR YOU:
• ✅ "Your compliance score improved 5% this month! Great work."
• 💰 "You've saved $1,247 this year vs filing yourself."
• 📊 "Businesses similar to yours typically file 3-4 documents
     per year. You're on track!"
• ⚠️ "Your health score will drop to 75 in 30 days if the
     annual report isn't filed."
```

**UPL Compliance:** ✅ General predictions are **legal information**, not advice.
