│                                                              │
│ The name you register must be advertised at least once in   │
│ a newspaper that is located within the county where your    │
│ principal place of business is located (Chapter 50,         │
│ Florida Statutes). However, proof of advertisement is not   │
│ required. You, the applicant, certify the name has been     │
│ advertised when you sign the application.                   │
│                                                              │

**UX Strengths:**
