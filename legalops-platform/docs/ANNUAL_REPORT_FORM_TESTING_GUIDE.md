## 🔍 Behind the Scenes

### What Happens When You Load the Form?

1. **Frontend** calls `/api/filings/annual-report?clientId=test-client-001`
2. **API** queries database for all active business entities for this client
3. **API** includes all related data:
   - Addresses (principal, mailing, agent)
   - Registered agent information
   - Managers/officers
   - Previous filings
4. **Frontend** receives data and auto-populates form
5. **User** just confirms and submits!

### What Happens When You Submit?

1. **Frontend** sends minimal data to `/api/filings/annual-report`:
   ```json
   {
     "businessEntityId": "test-entity-001",
     "confirmCurrentInformation": true,
     "correspondenceEmail": "john.doe@example.com"
   }
   ```

2. **API** creates a Filing record:
   - Links to existing BusinessEntity
   - Stores confirmation and email in `filingData` JSON field
   - Sets status to DRAFT (ready for AI agent to submit)

3. **Database** now has complete filing record
4. **AI Agent** (future) will submit to Sunbiz
