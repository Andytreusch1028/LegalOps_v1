## UPL Compliance Framework

### What is UPL?

**Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)** occurs when a non-lawyer provides legal advice, legal representation, or legal services that require professional judgment about the law as applied to a specific person's facts and circumstances.

### Critical Distinction

| ✅ **Legal Information (ALLOWED)** | ❌ **Legal Advice (PROHIBITED)** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| General facts about the law | Recommendations for specific situations |
| Procedural explanations | Interpretations of how law applies to user |
| Educational content | Predictions of legal outcomes |
| Definitions of legal terms | Suggestions on what user should do |
| Requirements and deadlines | Analysis of user's legal position |

### Florida Bar Guidelines

**Florida Bar Rule 4-5.5(a):** *"A lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so."*

**Key principle:** Providing factual information about legal processes is NOT practicing law. Applying legal principles to a specific person's situation IS practicing law.

## Content Writing Principles

### 1. Be Factual, Not Prescriptive

**❌ Prescriptive (advice):**
*"You should choose a professional Registered Agent to protect your privacy."*

**✅ Factual (information):**
*"A Registered Agent receives legal documents on behalf of your LLC. Many business owners choose a professional service to maintain privacy."*

### 2. Use Neutral Language

**❌ Directive:**
*"We recommend selecting S-Corp taxation for your business."*

**✅ Neutral:**
*"S-Corp taxation allows business income to pass through to your personal tax return while potentially reducing self-employment taxes. Consult a tax professional to determine the best option for your situation."*

### 3. Provide Context, Not Conclusions

**❌ Conclusive:**
*"An Operating Agreement will protect you from personal liability."*

**✅ Contextual:**
*"An Operating Agreement outlines your LLC's ownership structure and management rules. While not required by Florida law, it can help establish your LLC as a separate legal entity."*

### 4. Empower, Don't Direct

**❌ Directive:**
*"You must file your Annual Report by May 1st or your LLC will be dissolved."*

**✅ Empowering:**
*"Florida requires all LLCs to file an Annual Report by May 1st each year. Missing this deadline can result in late fees and potential administrative dissolution. You can file your Annual Report through LegalOps or directly with the Florida Division of Corporations."*

### 5. Acknowledge Complexity

**❌ Oversimplified:**
*"Choose Single-Member LLC taxation if you're the only owner."*

**✅ Acknowledges complexity:**
*"Single-Member LLC taxation means your business income is reported on your personal tax return (Schedule C). However, you may also elect S-Corp or C-Corp taxation depending on your situation. Tax classification has significant implications—consult a tax professional for guidance."*

## Approved Content Templates

### Template 1: Definition Tooltip

**Structure:**
```
[Term] is [simple definition]. [Additional context or why it matters].
```

**Examples:**

**Registered Agent:**
*"A Registered Agent is a person or business that receives legal documents and official correspondence on behalf of your LLC. Florida law requires all LLCs to have a Registered Agent with a physical Florida address."*

**Operating Agreement:**
*"An Operating Agreement is a document that outlines your LLC's ownership structure, management rules, and member responsibilities. While not required by Florida law, it helps prevent disputes and establishes your LLC as a separate legal entity."*

**EIN (Employer Identification Number):**
*"An EIN is a unique 9-digit number issued by the IRS to identify your business for tax purposes. You'll need an EIN to open a business bank account, hire employees, or file certain tax returns."*

### Template 2: Requirement Tooltip

**Structure:**
```
[What's required]. [Why it's required]. [Deadline or frequency]. [Consequence of non-compliance].
```

**Examples:**

**Annual Report:**
*"Florida requires all LLCs to file an Annual Report by May 1st each year. This report updates your business information with the state and keeps your LLC in good standing. Missing the deadline results in a $400 late fee, and continued non-compliance can lead to administrative dissolution."*

**Registered Agent Requirement:**
*"Florida law requires all LLCs to maintain a Registered Agent with a physical Florida address (no P.O. boxes). Your Registered Agent must be available during normal business hours to receive legal documents. Failure to maintain a Registered Agent can result in your LLC being administratively dissolved."*

### Template 3: Process Explanation Tooltip

**Structure:**
```
[What happens]. [Timeline]. [What you need to do]. [What happens next].
```

**Examples:**

**LLC Formation Process:**
*"After you submit your LLC formation documents, the Florida Division of Corporations typically processes them within 5-7 business days (or 1-2 business days with expedited processing). Once approved, you'll receive your Certificate of Organization via email. You can then obtain your EIN from the IRS and open a business bank account."*

**Name Availability Check:**
*"Before filing your LLC, Florida requires checking that your business name is available and not too similar to existing businesses. You can search the Florida Division of Corporations database to verify availability. If your name is taken, you'll need to choose a different name before proceeding."*

### Template 4: Option Comparison Tooltip

**Structure:**
```
[What this option means]. [Key characteristics]. [Common use cases]. [Disclaimer to consult professional].
```

**Examples:**

**Tax Classification Options:**
*"LLCs can choose how they're taxed by the IRS:*

*• **Single-Member LLC:** Income reported on your personal tax return (Schedule C)*
*• **Multi-Member LLC:** Partnership taxation with income passing through to members*
*• **S-Corp Election:** Pass-through taxation with potential payroll tax savings*
*• **C-Corp Election:** Separate corporate tax return with different tax rates*

*Tax classification has significant implications for your business. Consult a tax professional to determine the best option for your situation."*

### Template 5: Warning/Caution Tooltip

**Structure:**
```
[What to be aware of]. [Why it matters]. [What to do instead or how to avoid].
```

**Examples:**

**Public Record Warning:**
*"Your LLC's principal address will be public record and visible on the Florida Division of Corporations website. If you prefer to keep your home address private, consider using a commercial address or virtual office. Your Registered Agent's address will also be public record."*

**Name Reservation Expiration:**
*"Name reservations in Florida are valid for 120 days. If you don't file your LLC formation documents within this period, your reserved name will become available to others. You can renew your reservation for an additional 120 days if needed."*
