## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report evaluates the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) framework for AI code generation to determine if it would streamline our LegalOps v1 build process using Augment and Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **ADOPT WITH MODIFICATIONS** - The framework aligns well with our current workflow and can enhance our existing practices without introducing conflicting tools or technologies.

---

## üéØ **WHAT IS THE PDCA FRAMEWORK?**

### **Overview**
A structured approach to human-AI collaboration for code generation that maintains code quality while leveraging AI capabilities. Developed by Ken Judy (Senior Partner at Stride) through 18+ months of real-world use.

### **The 5-Step Cycle**

1. **Working Agreements** (1 min) - Human commitments to guide AI according to quality standards
2. **Plan - Analysis** (2-10 min) - AI analyzes business objective, existing patterns, alternative approaches
3. **Plan - Task Breakdown** (2 min) - AI creates numbered steps with acceptance criteria
4. **Do** (varies) - Test-driven implementation with human oversight
5. **Check** (5 min) - AI verifies implementation against objectives
6. **Act** (2-10 min) - Retrospective to improve prompts and interactions

### **Key Principles**
- Small batch sizes (1-3 hour coding sessions)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline
- Continuous improvement through retrospection
- Human accountability for all code committed
- Structured prompts over ad-hoc requests

---

## ‚úÖ **PROS - WHY THIS WOULD HELP US**

### **1. Aligns with Our Current Workflow**
**Current State:** We already use task management, structured planning, and iterative development.

**PDCA Benefit:** Formalizes what we're already doing informally:
- ‚úÖ We already break down work into tasks (task management tool)
- ‚úÖ We already review code before committing
- ‚úÖ We already use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (same model family as author)
- ‚úÖ We already work in focused sessions

**Impact:** Minimal disruption, maximum enhancement.

---

### **2. Addresses Real Problems We've Encountered**

**Problem 1: Scope Creep**
- **Current Issue:** You mentioned getting ahead of yourself with advanced features
- **PDCA Solution:** Structured planning with numbered steps and stop/go criteria
- **Benefit:** Keeps us focused on immediate objectives

**Problem 2: Code Quality Concerns**
- **Research Finding:** AI adoption correlates with 7.2% decrease in delivery stability (DORA 2024)
- **Research Finding:** 10x increase in duplicated code blocks (GitClear 2024)
- **PDCA Solution:** TDD discipline, pattern analysis, completion checks
- **Benefit:** Maintains quality while using AI

**Problem 3: Integration Issues**
- **Current Risk:** As codebase grows, maintaining consistency becomes harder
- **PDCA Solution:** Mandatory codebase searches for similar patterns before coding
- **Benefit:** Reduces regressions and maintains architectural consistency

---

### **3. Proven Results**

**Experimental Data (Same Story, Two Approaches):**

| Metric | Unstructured | PDCA | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|------|-------------|
| **Token Usage** | 1,485,984 | 1,331,638 | **10% reduction** |
| **Troubleshooting Tokens** | 1,221,217 (82%) | Minimal | **Massive reduction** |
| **Production Code Lines** | 534 | 350 | **34% less code** |
| **Test Code Lines** | 759 | 984 | **30% more tests** |
| **Methods Implemented** | 16 | 9 | **Simpler solution** |

**Key Finding:** 80% of unstructured tokens were spent AFTER the AI declared the task complete (debugging, fixing assumptions, resolving incomplete implementation).

**Research Backing:**
- Structured prompting outperforms ad-hoc by 1-74% (Sahoo et al. 2024)
- PDCA reduced software defects by 61% (Ning et al. 2010)

---

### **4. No New Tools or Technology Required**

**What We Need:** ‚úÖ Already have it
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 ‚úÖ (We're using it)
- Text editor / IDE ‚úÖ (We have VS Code)
- Git ‚úÖ (We're using it)
- Task management ‚úÖ (We're using Augment's task tools)

**What We DON'T Need:**
- ‚ùå No new software to install
- ‚ùå No new platforms to learn
- ‚ùå No additional costs
- ‚ùå No team coordination (works for solo developers)

---

### **5. Improves Developer Experience**

**Unstructured Approach:**
- Human interaction stacked at the end
- Focused on reviewing and troubleshooting
- Reactive problem-solving

**PDCA Approach:**
- Human interaction throughout planning and coding
- Proactive guidance and intervention
- Continuous feedback loop

**Your Context:** As a new programmer, this structured approach provides:
- Clear checkpoints to verify understanding
- Explicit stop/go criteria
- Built-in learning through retrospectives

---

### **6. Creates Valuable Documentation Artifacts**

**Artifacts Generated:**
1. **Analysis Document** - Business objective, patterns found, approach chosen
2. **Implementation Plan** - Numbered steps with acceptance criteria
3. **Completion Check** - Verification against objectives, outstanding items
4. **Retrospective** - What worked, what didn't, improvements for next time

**Benefit for LegalOps:**
- Can attach to Jira stories / GitHub issues
- Provides transparency for future reference
- Helps onboard others to the codebase later

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONS - POTENTIAL CHALLENGES**

### **1. Upfront Time Investment**

**Time Required Per Session:**
- Working Agreements: 1 min (one-time read)
- Analysis: 2-10 min
- Task Breakdown: 2 min
- Check: 5 min
- Act (Retrospective): 2-10 min
- **Total Overhead: ~11-28 minutes per coding session**

**Concern:** For very simple tasks (e.g., "fix this typo"), full PDCA may be overkill.

**Mitigation:** Author suggests scaling formality to task complexity (Crystal approach). Use lightweight version for simple tasks.

---

### **2. Learning Curve**

**Initial Setup:**
- Need to create working agreements document
- Need to craft/adapt prompt templates
- Need to establish quality metrics

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours to set up initially

**Concern:** Adds complexity when you're already learning to code.

**Mitigation:** 
- Start with author's templates (available on GitHub)
- Adapt gradually over time
- Focus on 2-3 key practices first, add more later

---

### **3. Requires Discipline**

**Human Responsibilities:**
- Must actually read and enforce working agreements
- Must review AI analysis before proceeding
- Must intervene when AI goes off track
- Must conduct retrospectives (easy to skip)

**Concern:** Requires consistent follow-through.

**Mitigation:** 
- Use Augment's task management to track PDCA steps
- Set reminders for retrospectives
- Start with just Plan-Do-Check, add Act later

---

### **4. May Feel Rigid Initially**

**Structured Process:**
- Must follow steps in order
- Must wait for analysis before coding
- Must write tests first (TDD)

**Concern:** May feel slower at first compared to "just start coding."

**Mitigation:**
- Remember: 80% of unstructured time was spent fixing problems
- Upfront investment pays off in reduced troubleshooting
- Can adapt framework to your style over time

---

### **5. Token Usage for Planning**

**Analysis Phase:** 106,587 tokens (8% of total)
**Planning Phase:** 20,068 tokens (1.5% of total)
**Total Planning:** ~10% of tokens

**Concern:** Uses more tokens upfront.

**Counter-Benefit:** Saves 10% overall tokens AND massive troubleshooting time.

## üîÑ **HOW IT COMPARES TO OUR CURRENT WORKFLOW**

### **What We're Already Doing:**

| Current Practice | PDCA Equivalent | Alignment |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Task management with subtasks | Plan - Task Breakdown | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| Codebase retrieval before edits | Plan - Analysis | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| Marking tasks IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETE | Check - Completion Analysis | ‚úÖ Good match |
| Reviewing code before committing | Check | ‚úÖ Good match |
| Using structured prompts | Working Agreements | ‚úÖ Good match |

### **What We're NOT Doing (But Should):**

| Missing Practice | PDCA Addition | Benefit |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| Formal working agreements | Working Agreements | Consistency across sessions |
| Test-Driven Development | Do - TDD Discipline | Catch bugs earlier |
| Retrospectives | Act | Continuous improvement |
| Quality metrics tracking | Measuring Success | Objective feedback |

## üí° **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Start Simple (Week 1-2)**

**Adopt These 3 Practices:**
1. **Working Agreements** - Create a simple 1-page document with your quality standards
2. **Plan - Analysis** - Ask AI to analyze codebase before coding (we already do this!)
3. **Plan - Task Breakdown** - Ask AI to create numbered steps (we already do this!)

**Skip For Now:**
- TDD (can add later)
- Formal retrospectives (can add later)
- Quality metrics (can add later)

**Effort:** ~2 hours setup, minimal ongoing overhead

---

### **Phase 2: Add Structure (Week 3-4)**

**Add These 2 Practices:**
4. **Check - Completion Analysis** - Ask AI to verify work against plan before committing
5. **Act - Quick Retrospective** - Spend 5 min after each session: "What worked? What didn't?"

**Effort:** +10 min per coding session

---

### **Phase 3: Full PDCA (Month 2+)**

**Add Remaining Practices:**
6. **TDD Discipline** - Write failing tests first, then make them pass
7. **Quality Metrics** - Track commit sizes, test coverage, etc.

**Effort:** Becomes natural part of workflow

---

## üìä **SPECIFIC BENEFITS FOR LEGALOPS V1**

### **1. Checkout Flow (Current Work)**
**Without PDCA:** 
- Jump straight to coding
- Fix bugs as they appear
- Hope we didn't break anything

**With PDCA:**
- Analyze existing checkout patterns first
- Plan numbered steps (we're already doing this!)
- Verify against plan before committing
- Learn from session for tiered pricing work

---

### **2. Tiered Pricing (Next Work)**
**Without PDCA:**
- Risk duplicating code across packages
- May miss integration points
- Troubleshoot after "complete"

**With PDCA:**
- Mandatory search for similar pricing patterns
- Identify all touch points upfront
- Test-driven implementation
- Smaller, focused commits

---

### **3. Month 3-6 Features**
**Benefit:** As codebase grows, PDCA becomes MORE valuable:
- Prevents architectural drift
- Maintains consistency
- Reduces technical debt
- Speeds up future work

---

## üéØ **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

## üìù **NEXT STEPS (IF YOU WANT TO PROCEED)**

### **Option A: Try It on Next Session**
1. I'll create a simple working agreements document for LegalOps
2. We'll use PDCA for testing the checkout flow
3. We'll do a quick retrospective after
4. You decide if it's worth continuing

**Time:** 30 min setup, then normal coding session

---

### **Option B: Wait Until After Checkout Flow**
1. Finish checkout flow testing with current approach
2. Set up PDCA before starting tiered pricing
3. Compare the two experiences

**Time:** No immediate change

---

### **Option C: Just Take the Good Parts**
1. Keep using task management (already doing)
2. Keep using codebase retrieval (already doing)
3. Add: Quick retrospectives (5 min after each session)
4. Add: Completion checks (verify against plan before committing)

**Time:** +10 min per session, no setup needed

## ‚ùì **QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

1. **Does this framework make sense for our workflow?**
2. **Which option appeals to you? (A, B, or C)**
3. **Are there specific parts you want to try first?**
4. **Any concerns I didn't address?**

---

**Bottom Line:** PDCA is a formalization of best practices we're already partially following. It won't conflict with Augment or Claude Sonnet 4.5 - it will enhance how we use them. The question is whether the structure is worth the upfront investment. Based on the research and our current trajectory, I believe it is.
