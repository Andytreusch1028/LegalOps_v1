## 🔧 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tailwind CSS Spacing Not Working
**Problem:** Tailwind classes like `gap-X`, `space-y-X`, `mb-X` were not creating visible spacing  
**Solution:** Used explicit inline styles with pixel values (e.g., `marginBottom: '48px'`)  
**Lesson:** CSS specificity issues require inline styles to override

### Challenge 2: Payment Method Icons Missing
**Problem:** Stripe's PaymentElement not displaying payment method icons (Card, Affirm, etc.)  
**Root Cause:** Icons are controlled by Stripe's rendering logic, not always displayed in 'tabs' layout  
**Current Status:** Liquid glass styling applied to tabs, but icons remain hidden  
**Future Action:** Plan to build custom payment method selector later in development
