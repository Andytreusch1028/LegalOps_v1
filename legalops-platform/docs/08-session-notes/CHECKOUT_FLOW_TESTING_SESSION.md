# Checkout Flow Testing Session
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Ready to Resume Testing  
**Next Session:** Resume in ~10 hours

---

## 🎯 **SESSION GOAL**
Complete the basic checkout flow and get Stripe payment processing working end-to-end.

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION**

### 1. **Stripe Account Setup** ✅
- Created Stripe test account
- Retrieved real test API keys
- Updated `.env` file with production keys:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Updated ✅
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Updated ✅
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Placeholder (will set up later)

### 2. **Code Fixes** ✅
- **Fixed:** `src/app/api/stripe/create-payment-intent/route.ts`
  - Changed import from `@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route` to `@/lib/auth`
  - Changed import from `new PrismaClient()` to `@/lib/prisma`
  
- **Fixed:** `src/components/LLCFormationWizard.tsx` (Line 221-222)
  - **Problem:** Order creation was successful but redirect failed with `/checkout/undefined`
  - **Root Cause:** API returns `{ order: {...}, orderId: "..." }` but wizard was accessing `order.id`
  - **Solution:** Changed to `data.orderId || data.order?.id` to handle both response formats

### 3. **Test Data Setup** ✅
- Ran `npm run seed-test-data` successfully
- Created test user:
  - **Email:** `john.doe@example.com`
  - **Password:** `password123`
- Created 2 test business entities
- Created test client, addresses, registered agents, managers

### 4. **Dev Server** ✅
- Confirmed server runs successfully on http://localhost:3000
- All routes compile without errors
- Stripe integration loaded correctly
