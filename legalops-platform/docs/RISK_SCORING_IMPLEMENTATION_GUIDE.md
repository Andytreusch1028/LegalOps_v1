# AI Risk Scoring Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement and use the AI-powered fraud detection and risk scoring system in LegalOps.

---

## üìã What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ‚úÖ
- Added `RiskAssessment` model to track all risk assessments
- Added risk-related fields to `Order` model
- Added enums: `RiskLevel`, `RiskRecommendation`, `ReviewDecision`

### 2. **AI Risk Scoring Service** ‚úÖ
- `src/lib/services/ai-risk-scoring.ts`
- Combines rule-based checks with GPT-4 AI analysis
- Works with or without OpenAI API key (graceful fallback)

### 3. **API Endpoints** ‚úÖ
- `POST /api/risk/assess` - Assess risk for an order
- `GET /api/risk/assess?orderId=xxx` - Get existing assessment
- `GET /api/risk/high-risk-orders` - List high-risk orders
- `POST /api/risk/high-risk-orders` - Update review status

### 4. **Admin Dashboard** ‚úÖ
- `/admin/risk-management` - View and manage high-risk orders
- Filter by risk level
- Review and approve/decline orders
- View detailed risk factors

### 5. **Test Page** ‚úÖ
- `/test-risk-scoring` - Test risk assessment with sample data
- Quick test scenarios (low risk vs high risk)
- Real-time AI analysis

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

```bash
cd legalops-platform

# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 2: Add OpenAI API Key (Optional but Recommended)

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Note:** The system works without OpenAI (using rule-based checks only), but AI analysis provides much better fraud detection.

### Step 3: Install OpenAI Package

```bash
npm install openai
```

### Step 4: Test the System

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/test-risk-scoring`
3. Try the "Low Risk Customer" and "High Risk Customer" scenarios
4. See AI analysis in real-time

## üí° How to Integrate into Order Creation

### Example: Add Risk Assessment to Order API

```typescript
// src/app/api/orders/create/route.ts
import { aiRiskScoring } from '@/lib/services/ai-risk-scoring';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  
  // 1. Create the order first
  const order = await prisma.order.create({
    data: {
      userId: body.userId,
      orderNumber: generateOrderNumber(),
      subtotal: body.subtotal,
      tax: body.tax,
      total: body.total,
      paymentMethod: body.paymentMethod,
      ipAddress: request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown',
      userAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown',
      isRushOrder: body.isRushOrder || false
    }
  });

  // 2. Run risk assessment
  const assessment = await fetch('/api/risk/assess', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      orderId: order.id,
      userId: body.userId,
      orderData: {
        total: body.total,
        services: body.services,
        isRushOrder: body.isRushOrder,
        paymentMethod: body.paymentMethod,
        ipAddress: order.ipAddress,
        userAgent: order.userAgent,
        billingAddress: body.billingAddress
      }
    })
  });

  const riskResult = await assessment.json();

  // 3. Handle based on risk level
  if (riskResult.assessment.recommendation === 'DECLINE') {
    // Auto-decline critical risk orders
    await prisma.order.update({
      where: { id: order.id },
      data: { orderStatus: 'CANCELLED' }
    });
    
    return NextResponse.json({
      error: 'Order declined due to high fraud risk',
      orderId: order.id
    }, { status: 403 });
  }

  if (riskResult.assessment.requiresReview) {
    // Hold order for manual review
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      orderId: order.id,
      message: 'Order is pending review',
      requiresReview: true
    });
  }

  // 4. Process order normally for low-risk orders
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    orderId: order.id,
    message: 'Order created successfully'
  });
}
```

## üéØ Risk Scoring Logic

### Risk Score Ranges

| Score | Level | Recommendation | Action |
|-------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 0-25 | LOW | APPROVE | Process automatically |
| 26-50 | MEDIUM | REVIEW | Standard processing, monitor |
| 51-75 | HIGH | VERIFY | Require ID verification |
| 76-100 | CRITICAL | DECLINE | Decline or manual review |

### Rule-Based Risk Factors

The system automatically checks for:

1. **Temporary Email** (+25 points) - tempmail.com, guerrillamail.com, etc.
2. **Prepaid Card** (+15 points) - Higher fraud risk
3. **New Customer + Large Order** (+20 points) - Account age < 1 day + order > $500
4. **Rush Order** (+10 points) - Fraudsters want service before detection
5. **Previous Chargebacks** (+40 points) - CRITICAL risk factor
6. **No Phone Number** (+5 points) - Harder to verify identity
7. **Large Order** (+10 points) - Orders > $1000
8. **Multiple Services** (+15 points) - Ordering 5+ services at once

### AI-Enhanced Detection

When OpenAI is configured, GPT-4 also analyzes:

- Behavioral patterns (unusual order combinations)
- IP address analysis (VPN/proxy detection)
- Email domain reputation
- Payment method risk
- Address mismatches
- Historical fraud patterns

## üìä Admin Dashboard Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin/risk-management`

### Features

1. **Filter by Risk Level** - View only CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW risk orders
2. **View Details** - Click any order to see full risk analysis
3. **Review Orders** - Four action options:
   - ‚úÖ **Approve Order** - Process despite risk
   - üîç **Request Verification** - Ask customer for ID
   - üëÅÔ∏è **Approve & Monitor** - Process but watch closely
   - ‚ùå **Decline Order** - Cancel and refund

### Review Workflow

1. Order flagged as high-risk appears in dashboard
2. Admin clicks order to view details
3. Admin reviews:
   - Customer information
   - Order details
   - AI reasoning
   - Individual risk factors
4. Admin makes decision and adds notes
5. Order is updated and removed from pending list

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Low Risk Customer (Should Score 0-25)

```javascript
{
  customerData: {
    email: 'legitimate@gmail.com',
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    phone: '555-1234',
    ipAddress: '192.168.1.1'
  },
  orderData: {
    amount: 299,
    services: ['LLC_FORMATION'],
    isRushOrder: false,
    paymentMethod: 'credit_card'
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:** LOW risk, APPROVE recommendation

### High Risk Customer (Should Score 76+)

```javascript
{
  customerData: {
    email: 'test@tempmail.com',
    name: 'John Smith',
    phone: '',
    ipAddress: '185.220.101.50' // Known VPN
  },
  orderData: {
    amount: 500,
    services: ['LLC_FORMATION', 'EXPEDITED_PROCESSING'],
    isRushOrder: true,
    paymentMethod: 'prepaid_card'
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:** CRITICAL risk, DECLINE recommendation

**Risk Factors:**
- Temporary email (+25)
- Prepaid card (+15)
- New customer + large order (+20)
- Rush order (+10)
- No phone (+5)
- VPN detected (+17 from AI)

**Total:** 92/100 - CRITICAL RISK

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### With OpenAI API

- **Cost per assessment:** $0.02-0.05
- **Monthly volume (100 orders):** $2-5
- **Monthly volume (1000 orders):** $20-50

### Without OpenAI API

- **Cost:** $0 (uses rule-based checks only)
- **Accuracy:** ~70% (vs 90% with AI)

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Risk assessments are stored securely in database
- IP addresses and user agents are logged for fraud prevention
- Customer data is only used for risk assessment
- Complies with standard fraud prevention practices

### Access Control

- Risk management dashboard should be admin-only
- Implement proper authentication before deploying
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)

### Audit Trail

- All risk assessments are logged with timestamps
- Review decisions are tracked with admin ID and notes
- Complete audit trail for compliance

---

## üìà Monitoring & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **False Positive Rate** - Legitimate orders flagged as risky
2. **False Negative Rate** - Fraudulent orders that passed
3. **Chargeback Rate** - Track actual fraud vs predictions
4. **Review Time** - How long manual reviews take
5. **Auto-Approval Rate** - % of orders processed automatically

### Tuning Risk Thresholds

Adjust point values in `ai-risk-scoring.ts` based on your actual fraud data:

```typescript
// Example: Increase prepaid card risk
if (order.paymentMethod === 'prepaid_card') {
  factors.push({
    factor: 'prepaid_card',
    severity: 'high', // Changed from 'medium'
    description: 'Prepaid cards are commonly used in fraud',
    points: 25 // Increased from 15
  });
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not found"

**Solution:** Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` file, or system will use rule-based checks only.

### "Risk assessment not appearing in dashboard"

**Check:**
1. Order has `requiresReview: true`
2. Risk assessment was created successfully
3. Database schema is up to date (`npx prisma db push`)

### "AI analysis is slow"

**Causes:**
- OpenAI API latency (typically 2-5 seconds)
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
- Run risk assessment asynchronously (don't block order creation)
- Cache common patterns
- Use webhooks for async processing

2. ‚úÖ Add OpenAI API key for AI-enhanced detection
3. ‚úÖ Integrate into order creation flow
4. ‚úÖ Train staff on risk management dashboard
5. ‚úÖ Monitor false positive/negative rates
6. ‚úÖ Adjust risk thresholds based on real data
7. ‚úÖ Set up alerts for critical risk orders

---

## üéì Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Always log risk assessments for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Review high-risk orders before processing
- ‚úÖ Track false positives and adjust thresholds
