### **2. FORM WIZARDS - LANGUAGE REVIEW**

#### **2.1 LLC Formation Wizard** ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Current Language Issues:**

**PROBLEMATIC:**
> "Florida law requires every LLC to have a registered agent"

**Why Problematic:** Stating legal requirements could be seen as legal advice

**SAFER ALTERNATIVE:**
> "According to Florida Statute 605.0115, every LLC must designate a registered agent. Consult an attorney if you have questions about this requirement."

---

**PROBLEMATIC:**
> "You must provide your own registered agent information"

**Why Problematic:** "Must" implies legal advice

**SAFER ALTERNATIVE:**
> "If you do not purchase registered agent service, you will need to provide registered agent information. Consult an attorney if you have questions."

---

**PROBLEMATIC (Tooltip):**
> "Describe the primary activities your business will engage in"

**Why Problematic:** This is fine - it's instruction, not advice

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE

---

#### **2.2 Annual Report Form** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

**Potential Issues:**
- Pre-filling information could be seen as advising customer
- Suggesting changes could be legal advice

**Safe Practices:**
- ✅ Show current information for reference only
- ✅ Customer decides what to change
- ✅ Clear disclaimer that we don't advise on changes

---

#### **2.3 Amendment Forms** ⚠️ NEEDS DISCLAIMERS

**Current Status:** Forms collect information but lack disclaimers

**Required Additions:**
- Disclaimer that we don't advise whether to make changes
- Recommendation to consult attorney for legal implications
- Clear statement that we only prepare documents

---

### **3. CUSTOMER-FACING TEXT REVIEW**

#### **3.1 Service Descriptions** ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Current Issues:**
- Some descriptions imply we "handle" legal matters
- Missing disclaimers on service pages
- No "not a law firm" statement visible

**Required Changes:**
- Add disclaimer to every service page
- Revise language to emphasize document preparation
- Add attorney consultation recommendations

---

#### **3.2 Marketing Copy** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

**Potential Issues:**
- Avoid language like "we'll take care of everything"
- Avoid implying legal expertise
- Avoid suggesting we can replace an attorney

**Safe Marketing Language:**
- ✅ "We prepare and file documents"
- ✅ "We handle the paperwork"
- ✅ "We streamline the filing process"
- ❌ "We'll handle all your legal needs"
- ❌ "No attorney needed"
- ❌ "We'll protect your business"
