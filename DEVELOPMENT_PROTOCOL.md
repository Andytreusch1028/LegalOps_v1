# LegalOps Development Protocol
## Build-Test-Iterate Methodology for Bug-Free Applications

**Created**: 2025-01-17  
**Purpose**: Ensure bug-free, usable application through traditional development cycles  
**Target**: Novice coders with emphasis on safety and reliability  

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. **Never Break What Works**
- Test existing functionality before adding new features
- Maintain backward compatibility at all times
- Use feature flags for new functionality
- Always have a rollback plan

### 2. **Test Early, Test Often**
- Write tests before writing code (TDD approach)
- Test each component in isolation
- Test integration between components
- Test the complete user journey

### 3. **Small, Safe Steps**
- Build one feature at a time
- Complete each phase before moving to the next
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Document everything you do

### 4. **UPL Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- Document preparation only - no legal advice provided
- Clear disclaimers required on all services
- Attorney referral system for complex matters
- Educational content only - no legal interpretation
- State-specific compliance (Florida focus)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Testing Pyramid**

```
    /\
   /  \
  /E2E \     (10% - Critical user journeys)
 /______\
/        \
/Integration\ (20% - API and service integration)
/____________\
/              \
/   Unit Tests   \ (70% - Individual functions and components)
/________________\
```

### **Test Types and Requirements**

#### **Unit Tests (70%)**
- **Coverage**: Every function and component
- **Focus**: Individual logic and edge cases
- **Speed**: Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- **Isolation**: No external dependencies

```javascript
// Example unit test
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123' };
    const user = await userService.createUser(userData);
    expect(user.email).toBe(userData.email);
    expect(user.id).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

#### **Integration Tests (20%)**
- **Coverage**: API endpoints and database interactions
- **Focus**: Component integration and data flow
- **Speed**: Medium execution (< 10 seconds per test)
- **Dependencies**: Database and external services

```javascript
// Example integration test
describe('User API Integration', () => {
  it('should create user via API', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123' })
      .expect(201);
    
    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
    expect(response.body.data.user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
  });
});
```

#### **End-to-End Tests (10%)**
- **Coverage**: Complete user journeys
- **Focus**: User experience and workflow
- **Speed**: Slow execution (< 60 seconds per test)
- **Dependencies**: Full application stack

```javascript
// Example E2E test
test('Complete user registration flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/register');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('[data-testid="register-button"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```
